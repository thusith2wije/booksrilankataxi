              >5.3 GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong
            ><br />
            While technology helps ensure the speed, dependability, and safety
            of our rides, people matter most to the BookSriLankaTaxi experience. And
            it's a two-way street between our Driver Partners and Passengers.<br /><strong
              >Professionalism & Respect</strong
            ><br />BookSriLankaTaxi maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding all
            forms of discrimination, harassment or abuse. <br /><strong
              >Non-discrimination</strong
            ><br />
            It is unacceptable to refuse to provide or accept services based on
            a person's race, religion, national origin, disability, sexual
            orientation, sex, marital status, gender identity, age or any other
            characteristic protected under applicable Sri Lankan law. This type
            of behavior can result in permanent loss of access to the BookSriLankaTaxi
            platform.<br /><strong>No inappropriate behavior</strong><br />
            Passengers and drivers expect each other to act appropriately and
            respect boundaries. It is disrespectful to make derogatory remarks
            about a person or group. Furthermore, commenting on appearance,
            asking overly personal questions and making unwanted physical
            contact are all considered inappropriate behaviors. Anyone who
            solicits or engages in sexual conduct while using the BookSriLankaTaxi
            platform may lose future access to BookSriLankaTaxi. We encourage you to be
            mindful of other users' privacy and personal space. Violence of any
            kind will not be tolerated.<br /><strong>Human Kindness</strong
            ><br />
            Calm and clear communication is the most effective way to defuse any
            disagreement that may arise between either parties. All Passengers
            and drivers expect to be treated with respect and courtesy by one
            another. This expectation extends to personal property as well. As a
            Passenger, it is your responsibility to treat your driver's vehicle
            with respect and not intentionally damage or remove their personal
            items from it. As a driver-partner, it is your responsibility to
            make every reasonable effort to return any lost items in your
            vehicle. It is best to treat a lost item respectfully. It is
            unacceptable to require additional payment to return an item; doing
            so could cause you to lose access to the BookSriLankaTaxi platform.<br /><strong
              >Safty</strong
            >
            <br />

            utmost concern. In order to best protect everyone in the vehicle, we

            Illegal substances and - unBookSriLankaTaxi explicitly allowed by law - open
            containers of alcohol are not permitted in drivers' vehicles. This
            is against the law and a serious violation of BookSriLankaTaxi's policy.
            Furthermore, BookSriLankaTaxi does not tolerate drug or alcohol use by
            drivers while using the BookSriLankaTaxi app, website or while serving a
            taxi service to a passenger booked through BookSriLankaTaxi. If Passenger
            believes a driver may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,
            please request that the driver end the trip immediately and inform
            BookSriLankaTaxi.and also Driver has discretion to give transportation to a
            Passenger under the influence of drugs or alcohol. BookSriLankaTaxi
            prohibits human trafficking of any kind, including the commercial
            sexual exploitation of children, while using our app. Anyone who
            engages in such activity may lose access to BookSriLankaTaxi. As a driver,
            it is your responsibility to transport Passengers safely in
            accordance with the rules of the road in your city. Driving when
            you're drowsy can cause accidents. So if you ever feel tired, take a
            break. And remember that according to the experts "sleep is the only
            true preventative measure against the risks of drowsy driving". As a
            Passenger, it is your responsibility to abide by the seat belt laws
            in your state(When required).<br /><strong>Disabilities</strong
